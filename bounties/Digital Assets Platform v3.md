# BOUNTY PROGRAM AGREEMENT

## PROJECT NAME
Digital Asset Platform

## VERSION
3.0

## ABSTRACT
There is no doubt that the Digital Asset Platform is on the critical path to the sucess of our project. As Fermat evolves and new architecture is designed an implemented in all platforms, DAP must follow this approach and improve itself to acommodate future changes.

This bounty is mainly an architecture improvement following new guidelines to modularize our processes into smaller pieces and enable reutilization, optimization and prepare for future transactions that DAP will be supporting shortly.



## SCOPE

### 1- Architecture re design:  
New architecture implementation as in [dev.fermat.org](http://dev.fermat.org). Full implementation of 33 new plugins.

**Size:** 40%  
**Fermat components:** 

* Asset Miner Agent
* Asset Transfer, Asset Redemption, Asset Distribution, Asset Issuing, Asset Fixed Bitcoin Price Direct Private Sell and Asset Break User Business Transactions
* Asset Hold and Asset Unhold Business Transactions.
* Multi Transaction Asset Issuing, Asset Break and Asset Transfer Digital Asset Transactions
* Incoming Asset Offer and Outgoing Asset Offer Transaction
* Asset For Bitcoin and Bitcoin For Asset Swap Transactions
* Incoming Asset Metadata and Outgoing Asset Metadata
* Incoming Crypto Transaction and Outgoin Crypto Transaction
* Asset Issuer Statisc Aggregator
* Asset Transfer, Asset Issuing and Asset Swap Statistics Collector.
* Asset Specific Offer
* Digital Asset Metadata
* Asset Issuer, Asset User and Redeem Point Actor Connection.
* Statistics and Offer Network Services.

### 2- GUI re design:  
Graphic improvements to Wallets and sub apps.

**Size:** 30%  
**Fermat components:** 

* Asset Issuer Wallet
* Asset User Wallet
* Redeem Point Wallet
* Asset Factory

### 3- bitDubai Refactor:  
Refactoring existing plugins to remove bitDubai name from components. 

**Size:** 0%  
**Fermat components:** 

* All existing plugins.

### 4- Incoming Assets Notification:  
Add funcionality to allow an asset receiver to choose or deny reception of a new asset. Changes include adding:

* Settings to specify if assets are accepted by default.
* Include notifications for incoming assets.
* Modify transactions flow to enable user response.


**Size:** 10%  
**Fermat components:** 

* Asset Transfer, Asset Distribution, Asset Redemption transactions.
* Asset User and Redeem Point wallets.

### 5- Outgoing Crypto Transaction events:  
Currently only incoming crypto transactions are handled by raising events from the Crypto Reouter plugin. We are going to improve the Outgoing transactions process by using the same procedure.

**Size:** 5%  
**Fermat components:** 

* Incoming Crypto Transaction and Outgoing Crypto Transaction DAP plugins.
* Crypto Router and CryptoNetwork plugines in BCH platform.

### 6- Bitcoin Fees specification:  
Asset transactions fee is payed from the Asset Vault using Bitcoins from the Asset. We want to improve this by giving the user the chance to pay the bitcoin transaction fee from the Bitcoin Vault.

**Size:** 15%  
**Fermat components:** 

* Bitcoin and Asset Vaults.
* Asset Transfer, Asset Distribution, Asset Redemption transactions.
* Asset User and Asset Issuer wallets.


## EVALUATION

### 1- Architecture re design: 
All existing transactions will be tested:

* Asset Issuing: being able to create Assets from the Asset Factory.

* Asset Distribution: transfer assets to an Asset User

* Asset Transfer: transfer assets between Asset Users.

* Asset Sell: sell an asset to an Asset User.

* Asset Redemption: redeem an asset to a Redeem Point.

* Asset Break, break an asset in Asset User, Asset Issuer and automatically after being expired.

* Statistics updated for all previous operations at Asset Issuer.

* Code check that the proposed architecture was followed.

### 2- GUI re design:  

Implementation of the following GitHub Issues:
